# bashes
Collection of bash scripts and includable functions for every-day use

Place files under ~/bin (and make sure to include this in your $PATH)




# sudo wrapper (s)
's' functions as a sudo wrapper.

Will either sudo args or spawn a root shell.


Personally, I just call it 's', which is quick and easy to remember.

Feel free to rename to whatever suits your needs.


> usage:

> s [cmd1 [arg1 [..]] cmd2 [arg1 [..]]]
