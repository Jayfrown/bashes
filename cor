#  OverlayFS allows multiple containers to concurrently
#  share a single [read-only] rootfs (lower), storing their respective
#  changes in their 'persistent_storage' (upper) directories.


#  assume the following local configuration
#  - LXD - Canonicals LXC daemon
#		 - images:gentoo/current/amd64 copied locally, auto-update, aliased 'gentoo'
#		 - container 'gentoo' with an emptied rootfs at ${lower_rootfs}, no overlays
#
#  - ${lower_rootfs} to be on tmpfs and in fstab (optional, but highly recommended)
#	 !! If you don't, the only gain is in diskspace, by reusing the base rootfs
#	 !! If you do, the whole base-system is always fully in-memory.
#

#  NOTES
#  - Definitely not production material
#  - Every rebuild (reboot) == potential upgrade in base, as the image aliased 'gentoo' is auto-updated
#  - http://frightanic.com/goodies_content/docker-names.php -- because lxc clone needs a target name
